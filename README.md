Examples of coding
EnemyAI is a folder of well, enemy AI I created for my "Game Select"(https://teammix.itch.io/game-select) project with my Experiment Game Design Class group. 
It has examples of:
  - Platforming and Top-Down shooter enemies
  - ranged and melee enemies
  - Path-following and stationary enemies, along with some who chase the player once they get in a spcific range.
  - Boss enemies, one with multiple phases and attacks.

"EndScreen" script is an example of my UI capabilities and how the player can move between 3 screens. 
  - The main endscreen which asks if they'd like to play again along with some important info
  - A stats screen
  - A credits screen
